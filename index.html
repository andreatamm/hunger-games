            <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he story of Katniss Everdeen's first appearance at the Capitol Couture<br>
                offices is so famous, for a time it was a staple of every cocktail party<br>
                conversation in the Capitol. So it goes that Everdeen was scheduled to<br>
                be photographed for the cover of our third issue, Ignis Glace, a highly guarded<br>
                secret so as to prevent a riot amongst her adoring fans. However, due to a<br>
                communication error, Katniss walked right through our front doors. The office<br>
                erupted in such deafening screams, (keep in mind those offices were<br>
                constructed out of molded titanium and glass) the front doors completely<br>
                shattered. Katniss, without skipping a beat, smiled and took a bow amongst the<br>
                shards of broken glass. That day, Katniss Everdeen was the most famous<br>
                woman in Panem. Today, speaking her name will get you killed.<br>
                <br>
                Fully aware of the dire consequences this may have, Capitol Couture is bringing<br>
                you the feature no one else dares to: an in-depth look at the once beloved<br>
                Capitol icon who became the voice of a revolution and changed Panem forever.

                Everdeen. But before she was a victor or a symbol for the rebellion, she<br>
                was a girl from 12. Her modest origins only make her story more unlikely,<br>
                as stardom is so rarely attained by citizens of the outer districts. Take a look at<br>
                the events and people that would come to define her.

                    taken to the Capitol on day of the<br>
                    reaping. Katniss Everdeen's selfless<br>
                    gesture to volunteer made a lasting<br>
                    impression on all of Panem. As she<br>
                    left to prepare for the gruesome<br>
                    battle ahead of her, she left behind<br>

                the field to interview actual members of the rebellion to learn more about<br>
                Katniss and shed light on the conflict outside the Capitol gates.
            </h4>
            <p>To them, she is the light in the darkness. They tell me this while we're sitting<br>
                around (what can only be described as) a cauldron heating up tonight's rabbit<br>
                stew. On this particular evening, I am dining with the rebels of District 2. How I<br> 
                arrived here is the result of four hovercrafts, seven trains, a 10-month<br>
                background check and every coin in my account at First Capitol Bank. The day<br> 
                was tiring, spent taking inventory of every weapon, every piece of armor, every<br> 
                single bullet. The group is exhausted, but this is my moment to ask about<br>
                Katniss. For the first time in a week, one of my questions isn't met with eyerolls.<br>
                They answer seriously and earnestly.<br>
                <br>
                The rebels live modestly. Their principles must be what nourish them, sincere<br>
                there is very little actual sustenance. From my understanding, the rebels here in<br>
                District 2 are better off than most. Many outlying districts (including 12) have<br> 
                endured such immense firebombings, there are almost no physical structures<br>
                left standing. The death toll is estimated to be in the tens of thousands. With so<br>
                many lost, it is evident the strongest of them all have survived. In Katniss,<br>
                they have a focus. Under the Mockingjay, they are united in their cause.<br>

            <p><span class="first-letter">W</span>hat is next for the rebels? They<br>
                are organizing. However they<br>
                have one very real obstacles in<br>
                their path. District 2 is home to the<br>
                Capitol's central military base<br>
                (nicknamed the â€œNut") which has yet to<br>
                be taken by them. Without control of this<br>
                strategic stronghold, the rebellion is<br>
                conceivably dead in the water. But given<br>
                the sacrifices these individuals have<br>
                made, stopping now is not an option. |<br>
                have no doubt it will be taken.<br>
                <br>
                Love her or despise her, Katniss<br>
                Everdeen has become a force unto her<br>
                own. We amplified her voice with<br>
                microphones and television cameras,<br>
                now her voice is carried by thousands of<br>
                individuals looking for retribution. And<br>
                they are coming for the Capitol. This is<br>
                no idle threat, a new era has arrived. And<br>
                amongst the rubble of the city we once.<br>
                held dear, the girl on fire will rise again.
